The core functionality of the **_`acknowledgeDelivery()`_** function is to take a non-empty
channel of delivery objects, loop over each of the objects,
convert each object into a generic struct object(T) and then call a function
with the struct object passed to it. After the function has been called on each object, 
we then take each delivery object and acknowlede it 
by calling the **_`delivery.Ack()`_** method on it 😤
