Declalre and bind makes sure that a queue exists and is attached to a certain Exchange. An Exchange is where data(messages) is sent to, and a queue needs to be bound to an Exchange so that messages sent to the Exchange could then be sent to any queue bound to it. The whole setup involves creating a channel using our rabbitMQ connection _`conn.Channel()`_, and using the returned channel to then create a queue object _`channel.QueueDeclare`_ and then bind that queue back to our channel _`channel.QueueBind`_
